# programming-kata
I use this repo to keep practising programming algorithms.

## Rule
I am alowed to use std if the algorithm or data structure is already implemented in this repo.

## To-Do
- [ ] Create folders to separate implementations, test and library (used to implement common algorithms and data structures)
- [ ] Research TDD in C++
- [ ] Implement https://www.spoj.com/problems/DISCRT/
- [ ] Create makefile
- [ ] Create problem_roadmap.md and figure out next problems to solve
